# transform_web_traffic.py

This Python script processes log data generated by a web server. It aggregates the time that users spent on each path and generates a pivot table. The output table can be used to analyze which paths are most popular, which users are the most active and many other questions as well.

# Installation
This script requires the use of Python 3.6 or above. There are also several packages which are required that are not included in the standard library. Download the `requirements.txt` file and run the following command to ensure that your environment has the necessary packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once your environment is ready, you can download the `transform_web_traffic.py` script and run it in whatever location you choose.

# Input

The input to the script are a set of comma-separated value (CSV) files. These files are stored in S3. The CSV files must contain certain fields to be processed successfully.

Field | Data Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
user_id | integer | The unique identifier for the user visiting the page.
path | string | The page within the website that the user visited. The field must be formatted as a slash followed by an identifier and optional additional pairs of slashes and identifiers. For example, `'/features/desktop'` is a valid path.
length | integer | The length of time the user spent on the page in seconds.

Any additional fields in the CSV file will be ignored. If these three required columns aren't present, the CSV file won't be processed. Any records in the CSV files that have malformed `path` fields or non-integer `length` fields will be ignored.
